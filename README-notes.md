## Approach and Priorities
- Removing space all around.
- Fixing navbar: color updated, h1 centered and font-size & color updated, menu button updated, menu updated.
- Grid positioning done.
- Profile component: profile picture border radius updated, components flex & justification updated, favorites' cards created.
- Personal info component: mat-card padding removed, border-radius updated, card header updated, card items updated.
- Socials component: same CSS as previous.
- Messages component: same CSS as above + card shape updated, images updated, overlaping images created, message border provided.
- Feed component: same CSS as above + card shape updated, icon & image updated.

## Ignored due to time limitation:
- Mobile version responsiveness will take more time and design considerations, e.g., personal-info, socials, messages, feed need to flow below the profile, profile picture size adjustment, text flow adjustment etc.
- Bootstrap used after trying "material grid list" and "flexible layout". These will take some more time to understand as I have never used them before.
- Personal info and Socials components: edit mode items' gap adjustment skipped, edit mode & not edit mode card height adjustment skipped.
- Messages component: 'plus' button functionality skipped.
